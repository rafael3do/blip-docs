# Integrations

Integrations are external platforms connected with **Blip** in order to provide different capabilities for their chatbots. The most common type of integrations are the [channels](#channels) but there are others like payment for instance.

As the other platform nodes, each integration has a unique address with `postmaster@[identifier].msging.net` format. The `identifier` value is the integration sub domain. Thus, to send *commands* or *messages* use this address. If you don't know what is a command or how you can use this on Blip, please go to [Concepts > Commands](#commands) section.
